CHAPTER 1
-----------------
Introduction
---------------
->the process of designing interactive arterfacts to be effective,
efficient, easy, safe and enjoyable.
->enjoyable to  use is an important aspect of system design.
Because it helps people and the society appreciate the benefit o
f computation-based devices.
->One major concern of a system failure os the narrow optimization of
a design that does not fully cater for contextual/appropriate factors.
->Human(users) and their context circumstance are major component of the problem space that cannot be ignored
->The greatest percentage of a program code in any interactive systems concentrates with user interaction.
->Failure to focus on users and their tasks context not only leads to
poor user interfaces but also puts the entire system to risk

Two reason why projects fails 
  1)lack of user input during the design and development process
  2)Lack of requirements that the final product/system should meet in the end.
  
  
  Technology-driven VS user-centered design 
  --------------------------------------------
  ->the technology runs the design of the interface which give the user the
  functionality of the system(technology driven)
  ->or users may put demand on the functionality of the interface which runs
  the design on the  technology(user-centered design).
  
  ->human computer interaction(HCI) can also be referred as Human Computer Interface(HCI),
  Man-machine interaction(MM), advanced User interface(AUI)
  ->Computer Human Interaction(CHI) or user interface(UI)
  
  
  Definition of HCI
  --------------------
  ->HCI is the study of how people interact with computers and to what extent computers
  are or are not developed for successful interaction with human beings.
  ->Also can be defined as a multi-disciplinary subject concerning  with the 
  design  of interactive systems in the context with the design  of interactive
  systems in the context of user's  task and work.
  ->Also defined as the study  of the interaction of humans and computers  with intent of developing 
  better ways for computer to interact with people.
  ->Discipline concerned with the design, evaluation and implementation of interactive
  computing systems for human  use and with the study of major phenomena surrounding them.
  ->disciple which is neither the study  of humans nor the study  of technology, but rather the bridging between those two.
  
  
  Questions for designers
  ---------------------------
  ->what can the technology do?
  ->how can you build it
  ->what are the possibilities?
  ->
  
  
  
  Diagrammatic representation of HCI
  -----------------------------------
  Human->actions->machine->functions->Goals
                             
  
  ->Users/Humans - individual , group of users closely 
  working together or  a sequence in an organization each dealing with some part
  of the task/process of the overall task.
  ->computer - any technology ranging from pc, VCR, mobile phones, large scale 
  computers.
  ->Interaction - Any kind of communication between the user(human) and system which could 
  direct or indirect.
  Interaction ensure that humans and machines get with each other and interact 
  succcessfully.
  

Goals Of HCI
-----------------
->To develop or improve the safety, utility, effectiveness,  efficiency and 
 usability of system that include computers
 ->safety deals with the design of safety-critical systems, 
 ->utility deals with the functionality of a system,
 ->Usability is involved with making systems easy to learn and easy to use.
 
 condition to produce computer system with good usability, developers should
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ->Understand the factors that determine  how people use technology.
 ->Develop tools and techniques to enable building suitable/interactive systems.
 ->Achieve effecient, effective, and safe interaction
 ->Put people I.e users of the artefact first.
 ->


Disciplines Contributing and benefiting from HCI
----------------------------------------------------
->Computer science - provide knowledge about the capability of technology and ideas about how this potential can 
harnessed.
                   - It equips designers with skills to support  software analysis 
                     , design, developement and maintenance of systems
->Cognitive psychology - concerned with understanding human behavior and the mental 
                        processes  that underlies it.
                        -Key areas of concern are perception, attention, memory,
                         learning , thinking and problem solving
->Artificial intelligence - concerned with the development of intelligence computers
                           programs with simulate different aspects of intelligent human behavior.
 ->Philosophy, sociazing and anthropology - deals with impact of introduction of IT to society.
 ->Business - concern with marketing the artifacts
 ->Graphics designs - In order to produce appealing and effective presentations.
 ->Techical writing - this discipline helps to produce an effective interface presntation.
 ->Engineering and Design - Engineering is an applied science that takes the findings of science 
                            and the utelizes it in the production of objects.
                            Design contributes skill and knowledge to this process.
  ->Social $ organization psychology - helps us to understand the wider context of interaction.
                                     -it is concerned with studying the natural and causes of human behaviour in a social context.
                                     
                           

Approaches of creating systems
----------------------------------
->There are 4 :
      1)Cognitive - considers the ability of the human brain
                    and sensory preception in order to develop and interface that will support the end
                    user.
      2)Predictive modelling approach - tries to predict what the user can do. examining
      individual components of users experience in terms of the time it takes a user to
      most complete a goal.
      3)Anthropomorphic - Involve designing a user interface to possess humanlike qualities
                         e.g an interface may be designed to communicate with users in
                         a human to human manner as if the computer empathized with the user.
                         using error messages like "we are sorry the page cannot be found"
     4)Empirical approach - this approach is useful for comparing the usability of many
                           conceptual design 
                           Test done by conducting usability tests on each design concept.
                           Often users will appreciate specific elements of each design concept
                           which may lead to the developement of a composite conceptual design.
                           
                           
                           
                      Why HCI is important
                      ---------------------
->To achieve effecient, effective and safe product/systems.
    productivity(introducing technology that does not support the work may cause reduced productivity)
    safety(crashed air planes and nuclear power plants disasters have led to an understanding why HCI is important)
->Products and systems cannot be developed and designed using the developers/designers themselve as 
the norm
->Users might not have a greate interest in technology.


Effects of bad user interface
---------------------------------
->Increased user frustration which causes low productivity and/or utilization
->Increased mistakes in data entry and system operation.
->Inaccessibility functionality 
->system failures because of user rejection


Interaction design 
----------------------
->Aimed a dsigning interactive products to support people in their everyday and worksing lives.
->It also aims at creating user experiences that enhances and entend the way people work, communicate and interact.
->It is not only concerned with the same HCI fundamentals in terms of userbility goals.
->It is not only concerned with the same HCI fundamental in terms  of usability goals
  and design methodology , but also with  other goals.
->Its is concerned with creating systems that are satisfying enjoyable, fun, entertaining, helppful, motivating.
  aesthetically pleasing, supportive of creativity rewarding and emotionally fulfilling.
 
 Design issue
 ----------------
 ->Four design issues as listed below;
                 knowing the user
                 reduce cognitive load
                 engineer for errors
                 Maintain consistency and clarity
                 
                 
                 
  Know your users
  ----------------
  ->You need to have General knowledge about humans(cognitive and perception psychology).
  ->This can be done by performing user analysis to know specific group.
  ->The rationale behind this is to minimized cognitive load and use resource effeciently
  
  
  Important information of the users includes
  -----------------------------------------------
  ->physilogy - how the eye/brain reacts to certain colours and colour combinations.
  ->Fatigue - how to create comportable workstations and peripherals.
  ->Psychology - limitation of memory
  ->Social psychology - how people work in groups, or in certain works environments.
  ->previous experience, knowledge and capabilities.
  ->Knowledge about computers:
                      programming
                      use of authoring/prototyping 
                      software, graphics software and HCI principles
                      such as how  to use colour effectively
                      how to prevent/correct errors, using icons 
  
  
  Reduce cognitive load
  -------------------------
  ->Making functions, objects and information visible.
  ->since the human brain is limited in its capability: 
   memory attention.
   
   
   Engineering for errors 
  -------------------------
  ->Make it difficult for the user to make error eg.
  ->Menus give the user the possibility alternatives(prevents  error but not mistakes)
    , sound  can indicate right/wrong 
  ->Provide good error  messages to lessen user frustration
  ->provide reversibility actions to allow users to correct their own errors
  ->Provide feedback-  so that know the state of the system.
  
  Maintain consistency and clarity
  -----------------------------------
  ->Maintains the standard operations and representations.
  ->E.g appropriate metaphors helps building and maintaining users's mental models
  ->By maintaining consistency and clarity, it becomes easier for users to learn, 
  recognize and to foresee what is going to happen .
  
  
  Forces shapping the future of HCI
  ------------------------------------
  ->the following technologies are taunted to shape the future of HCI:
           1)Large memories and faster systems.
           2)Networks communications and distributed computing.
           3)New display technologies. 
           4)specialized hardware.
         five)widespread use of computers.
         six)innovation and input technology.
         
  
   Recognition Vs Recall
   ----------------------
   ->HCI is neither the study of humans nor computer but  the bridge between these two.
   ->Its role is to enhance the quality of interaction between humans and  computers systems.
   ->This is achieved through systematically applying knowledge abouts humans's goals, capabilities and limitations 
     with knowledge about computer's capabilities and limitations.
         
  
Chapter 2
----------------
->what is i should know after this chapter
             .Cognitive phycology and its importance during system deveopment
             .Different cognitive aspects and how  they can be encouraged during design
             .How color guideline can help to design appealing interfaces.
             .optical illusion, context in system development.
             
             
               Introductions
               ----------------
->interacting with technology is cognitive-need to consider cognitive processes involved and cognitive limitations of user.
->cognitive phycology - a branch of psychology that studies mental processes 
                      - how people thinks, perceive , remember and learn.
                      -focus  on the way humans process infromation(how we treat information
                        that  comes in to the person stimuli and how this treatment leads to response.
                       -Its more intersted in the variablea that intercede stimulus and response.
                        
->there a number of benefit associated with cognitive phycology as far as HCI is concerned.
 
 
 Benefits of cognitive  phycology
 -----------------------------
 1. Determine what the users are likely to find easy and how we  the designer can help them by encouraging these things.
 2.Designers can determine how end users perceive the world around them, how they(users) store these info as process
 3.identify $ explain the nature  and cause of problems user encounter.
 4.Understand different type of users and  why certain designs are successful while others fail
  it lack the benefits  provided by the object-oriented approach.
  
->When programmer combine the thousands  of global functions and data types 
  defined by the 



User Requirement
--------------------------------
-Requirement set by the user.
-Expresses how a facility, equipment or process should perform in terms of the products to be manufactured, required throughput, 
and condition through which products should be made.
-Provides information that serves as the basis for further specification, design and verification of a manufacturing system.
-The common qz is how much details should be in the user requirement.
-Some categories it into : process user requirement which relates to product requirment.
-General user requirment, is related to critical to personnel safety.

Process user Requirement
----------------------------
-Critical process parameter the system must support
-critical quality attributes or product  release criteria that system must impart or preserve.
-Process/ product specific regulatory requirements
-
General user Requirement
------------------------------

Chapter 4
------------
->x-tic of the design process
-----------------------------
1.focus on the users . involves the users in the design process.
2.specific userbility and user experience
3.iteration. 

Knowing your users
-------------------
1.are they old user, young user, experience computer users or novice?
2.



Technqui of knowing your users
-----------------------------------
-fact finding methods
-participatory design
-watch
-use your imagination
-Using the personas


Required analysis
----------------------
any condition that has to be met  or possess by a system component to satisfy a contract,
standard  specification

types of requirements
---------------------------
-Functional requirement use formal informal or semiformal notation or suitable mixture ir
pseudocode, algorithm flow charts
-non functional, tell some behavior of the system, ie security,  the cultural and political environment the
system operates
-Data - captures the kind of data needs to be stored in the databases and how they will be relating to one onother.
-user requirements - ie captures the characteristics off the user eg cultural, education.
-Environmental requirement - ccaptures the circumstance in which the product will be expected to operate.
can be:
     1)physical 
     2)social 
     3)organisational(heirarchy, IT departments attitude, user support, 
     communic
-Usability - captures the usability related goals learnability, throught

Requirement gathering techniques
------------------------------------
->Questionnaire

  require different kinds of answers 
  Give quantitative or qualitatives data
  
  ->interviews
  Good for exploring  issues
  can be structured unstructured or semi-structured
  forum for talking to people but  a are time cunsuming
 -> workshop
  Useful if you want to gain a consensus view and/or highlighting area of confict.
  ->observationd
  stakeholderrs are to watched as they perform their day-to-day tasks
  good for understanding the nature and context of the tasks
  ->study the existing documentation(procedures and rules)
  elicit data abouut the steps the s
